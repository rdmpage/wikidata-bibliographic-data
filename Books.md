# Books

[WikiProject Books](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:WikiProject_Books) separates works and expressions, but not everyone uses this model

## Work

Instance of literary work (Q7725634)
Author, title, 

Work-level identifiers: OCLC work id

Has edition (list editions - they will typically have ISBNs)


## Expression

Expression-level identifiers include ISBN, ISBN13, Google Books.


## All together

Another approach is one item for the book and all its formats, and list multiple ISBNs. e.g. https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37308145 (instance of non-fiction book and literary work)

## Data

OCLC linked data, e.g. http://experiment.worldcat.org/oclc/28632410.jsonld, needs OCLC id (work)
